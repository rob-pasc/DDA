- `tooltip-tag` goes transparent when hovering over it, so that it doesn't hinder the user
- `context wheel` should have more options (maybe 8?)
- `artificiality score` is always at 94% -> make it dynamically responsive to clues found
- for `final verdict`: `selected` tag should also appear for clicking the `legitimate` option, not just for `malicious`
- the weird line-break after "needful" should also be a clue (maybe "unnatural styling" or something similar?)
